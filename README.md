[![üáµüá±](https://flagcdn.com/w20/pl.png) Czytaj po polsku](README.pl.md)

## üìå Description

The **CONSILIUM** project was developed as part of my bachelor‚Äôs thesis in Computer Science. The goal was to create a real web application that supports medical professionals in the consultation process, while also developing skills in **React**, **REST API**, UX, and frontend-backend system design.

## Purpose of the application

The application serves as a **closed discussion forum** for doctors, supporting the diagnostic process by enabling the exchange of knowledge, experiences, and joint analysis of clinical cases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies

- **React.js** ‚Äì main framework for building the user interface
- **React Router** ‚Äì handling multiple views in a SPA
- **Axios** ‚Äì ommunication with the backend REST API 
- **Context API** ‚Äì global application state (authorization, user)
- **Material UI** ‚Äì component library

## ‚ú® Main features (frontend)

- Login / registration / verification of doctors
- Browsing and filtering discussion threads
- Creating new topics and adding comments (and replies to comments)
- Responsive interface adapted to various devices
- Private discussions between doctors
- Session management and token-based authorization
- Real-time notifications
